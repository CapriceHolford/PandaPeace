### Accessibility Considerations
Accessibility was a key focus when designing Panda Peace. The site adheres to WCAG guidelines, ensuring all images have appropriate alt text and that there is sufficient colour contrast for readability. Additionally, the use of clear headings and simple language ensures the site is accessible to a broad audience.

## AI Tools Usage
I used ChatGPT to write the text on the site. 

## Features Implementation

Core Features (Must-Haves)
Quick Escape Button: A visible button that allows users to quickly exit the site by redirecting them to a neutral page (Google). This feature enhances user privacy and safety.
Mental Health Resources: Informative articles on mental health topics, such as Complex PTSD, and links to support services, including helplines and mental health organizations.

### Optional Features (Could-Haves)
Responsive Design: The site was designed with mobile-first principles, ensuring it is fully responsive and works seamlessly across different devices and screen sizes.
Complex PTSD Section: A dedicated section providing in-depth information about Complex PTSD, its symptoms, and available resources for those affected by prolonged trauma.

## Testing and Validation
Testing was conducted across multiple devices and browsers using Chrome DevTools to ensure the site’s responsiveness and usability. Minor issues with button alignment on mobile devices were identified and resolved.

### Validation
Both the HTML and CSS code were validated using the W3C and Jigsaw validators. All major errors were addressed, and warnings were resolved, ensuring the site meets web standards for accessibility and performance. I also checked with chatgpt as well to ensure there were no errors. 

### GitHub Copilot
Brief reflection on the effectiveness of using AI tools for debugging and validation.  
**Guidance:** Reflect on how GitHub Copilot assisted with debugging and validation, particularly any issues it helped resolve.

## Deployment

### Deployment Process
The deployment process was carried out using GitHub Pages. The main challenge encountered was ensuring the site rendered properly on mobile devices post-deployment, which was resolved by adjusting media queries.

### Reflection
### Successes
Effective use of GitHub Copilot to streamline coding and debugging tasks.
Successful integration of the Quick Escape function, enhancing the website's privacy features.
### Challenges
One of the challenges was ensuring consistency across different screen sizes, particularly with button placement and image scaling, which required additional testing and refinement. I also had a hard time making the navbar, it just wouldn't work for me. 

### Final Thoughts
Provide any additional insights gained during the project and thoughts on the overall process.  
**Guidance:** Begin drafting reflections during Phase 1 and update throughout the project. Finalize this section after Phase 4. Highlight successes and challenges, particularly regarding the use of AI tools, and provide overall insights into the project.

## Code Attribution
I used https://getbootstrap.com/ for the bootstrap elements, I also used ChatGPT to help me write the javascript portion of the site as I haven't learnt javascript yet.

## Future Improvements
In future I could add: 
User Accounts: Adding a feature for users to create accounts and save articles or resources for future reference.
Chat Functionality: Implementing a chat feature that connects users with mental health professionals or support groups.
